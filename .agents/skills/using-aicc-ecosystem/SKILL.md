# Use the AI Commander ecosystem correctly

This repository is `job-agent`: Python/Playwright job discovery, scoring, tailoring, ATS automation, receipt verification, and duplicate-submission-safe reconciliation.

Before changing a cross-service integration, read the ecosystem map in the repository root `AGENTS.md`. Then:

1. Identify the owning repository and verify its current contract/source/tests.
2. Reuse its API, scheduler, policy, approval, secret, memory, routing, or observability boundary; do not create a parallel owner here.
3. Resolve secrets through `aicc-secrets`. Never expose plaintext, age private keys, decrypted environment output, or reuse another service's scoped credential.
4. Treat `render-sync-map.json` as a least-privilege distribution allowlist. Update producer, consumer, mapping, and documentation together.
5. Treat Tailscale as transport, not authorization. Current verified uses are Job Agent noVNC re-auth and supported Code Review Agent Ollama tunneling; the broader Coordinator/worker mesh remains planned until accepted.
6. Preserve local-first, fail-closed behavior and reconcile ambiguous side effects before retry.
7. Validate completion with current tests/configuration/runtime evidence; model output, reachability, or a stored secret is not proof.
