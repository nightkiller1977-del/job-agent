# Pattern, Reuse, Simplicity
1. Find the closest existing implementation first.
2. Reuse existing services, helpers, adapters, schemas, config, tests, and contracts.
3. Make the smallest change that satisfies the requirement.
4. Avoid new layers/dependencies unless they solve a demonstrated problem.
5. Preserve established contracts/naming unless change is required.
6. If a new pattern is required, explain why the existing one cannot safely work.
